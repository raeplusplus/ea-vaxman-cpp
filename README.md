# Vax-Man Game - EA Internship Task
For my virtual internship with EA game studios, I was assigned to change the logic in Pacman using C++. 

Originally, I forked over the base PacMan C++ code from: https://github.com/patriciateroltolsa/Pacman , but didn't end up using it outside of reading the syntax.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** C++

I used the base code for PacMan to understand the C++ language, then went in and updated the original rules to the new ones: 
- Vax-Man can kill a ghost if he comes into contact with it (vaccinates it).
- Contact with a ghost does not kill Vax-Man.
- Each ghost that has not yet been hit multiplies itself every 30 seconds (the infection grows).
- The goal of the game is to collect all the dots before the number of ghosts grows to 32 times the original number.

## Lessons Learned:

This was my first time reading and working with the C++ language. I learned the basic syntax and logic needed in the game and made my changes through trial and error. Eventually, with my newfound understanding of C++, Vax-Man was created.
